threadpool.c is the exercise file and you need threadpool.h the header file

The main function creates a pool of threads, threads wait for jobs.

the task function prints the thread id 1000 times,
add sleep for 100 milliseconds after each print.

in the main function i add while loop because that he done from the main and destroy the thread 
pool and he well enter a deadlock and i solve it with this while loop that he well wait until 
all taskes end
